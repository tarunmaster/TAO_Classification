NVIDIA Driver Issues: Ensure compatibility with the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit by verifying that the appropriate driver is installed. Address any discrepancies or conflicts that may arise during the installation process.

Docker Challenges: Occasionally, Docker may encounter issues that require either a system restart or the addition of the user to a specific group. Resolve these challenges promptly to ensure seamless Docker functionality.

Initialization Error with Nvidia Container: If encountering an initialization error with the message 'Error response from daemon: failed to create shim task...,' specifically related to the 'libnvidia-ml.so.1' file, consider a comprehensive troubleshooting approach. In some cases, a reinstallation of the operating system may be necessary for resolution.

Path Configuration: Verify the correct definition of paths for all files, including training and testing datasets. Ensure that paths are correctly mounted within the Docker environment to prevent any potential path-related errors.
